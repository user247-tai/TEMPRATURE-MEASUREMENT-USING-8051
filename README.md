# TEMPRATURE-MEASUREMENT-USING-8051
Creating a product that measures temperature with low cost but high efficiency
In this project, we built an ambient temperature measuring device with low cost and high accuracy (but there are still negligible numbers). The instruments that we use are inexpensive devices and we try to make the measurement quality of the equipment highly accurate. Thereby creating a product that measures temperature with low cost but high efficiency.
